---
## About pet-project ##
I want to practice in scraping and simple data analysis in this project. The idea of this project is to find artists that more profitable to invest in their paintings. Of course, we need information about changing prices in the period of time for this. But for the beginning, I just scrape data for the first time and look what this data about.
## How to use it ##
First of all you will need Anaconda. You can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Most of the necessary packages are included in Anaconda toolkit, but if you need something you can install it in  Anaconda environment or manually using conda or pip.
Then clone repository or download data and that is all. You can use it.
